A search is presented for non-coloured supersymmetric particles in the vector-boson fusion (VBF) topology using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $19.7\fbinv$ collected with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8\tev$. This is the first search for SUSY in the VBF topology. The search utilizes events in eight different final states covering both same- and opposite-sign dilepton pairs. The leptons considered are electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying $\tau$ leptons. The VBF topology requires two well-separated jets that appear in opposite hemispheres, with large invariant mass \mjj. The observed \mjj distributions do not reveal any evidence for new physics. The results are used to exclude a range of \charginopm and \neutralinotwo gaugino masses. For models in which the \neutralinoone lightest-supersymmetric-particle mass is zero, and in which the \charginopm and \neutralinotwo branching fractions to $\tau$ leptons are large, \charginopm and \neutralinotwo masses up to $300\gev$ are excluded at $95\%$ CL. For a compressed-mass-spectrum scenario, in which $m(\charginopm) - m(\neutralinoone) = 50\gev$, the corresponding limit is 170\gev. While many previous studies at the LHC have focused on strongly coupled supersymmetric particles, including searches for charginos and neutralinos produced in gluino or squark decay chains, and a number of studies have presented limits on the Drell-Yan production of charginos and neutralinos, this analysis obtains the most stringent limits to date on the production of charginos and neutralinos decaying to $\tau$ leptons in compressed-mass-spectrum scenarios defined by the mass separation $\Delta m = m(\charginopm) - m(\neutralinoone) < 50\gev$.
