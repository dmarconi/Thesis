	\caption{An event display of a simple hadronic jet in the $(x, y)$ view (Figure \ref{fig:PF_a}) and in the $(\eta,\phi)$ view, where $\eta$ stands for pseudo-rapidity and $\phi$ for the azimuthal angle, on the ECAL surface (Figure \ref{fig:PF_b}) and the HCAL surface (Figure \ref{fig:PF_c}). (These two surfaces are represented as two circles centred around the interaction point in the first view.) The $K^{0}_{L}$, the $\pi^{-}$ and the two photons from the $\pi^{0}$ decay are detected as four well separated ECAL clusters (Figure \ref{fig:PF_b}). The $\pi^{+}$ leaves no energy in the ECAL. The two charged pions are reconstructed as charged-particle tracks, appearing as vertical solid lines in the $(\eta,\phi)$ views and circular arcs in the $(x, y)$ view. These tracks point towards two HCAL clusters (Figure \ref{fig:PF_c}). In all three views, the cluster positions are represented by dots, the simulated particles by dashed lines, and the position of their impact on the calorimeter surfaces by various open markers.}

\section {The Tau Lepton reconstruction}

With a lifetime of $2.9\times10^{âˆ’13}$ s and a mass of 1776.82 \mev the $\tau$ is the heaviest of the leptons. It was discovered between 1974 and 1977 by the team under Martin Perl while studying the $e^{+}+e^{-}\longrightarrow e^{\pm}+\mu^{\mp}$. The $\tau$ decays leptonically, with a branching ratio of $17\%$ for each channel, via the following decay $\tau\longrightarrow\nu_{\tau}W^{*}\longrightarrow\nu_{\tau}l\nu_{l}$. However the most important decay channel is the hadron one with a total branching fraction of $\sim 65\%$. Among all the possible hadronic decays as shown on Table \ref{table:tau_hdecay} the ones called "one-prong", where only one charged hadron is produced, are the most frequent.
