This thesis presents one of the first searches for supersymmetry in the vector-boson fusion topology. The search targets final states with at least two hadronically decaying tau leptons, large missing transverse momentum, and two jets with a large separation in rapidity. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7\invfb of proton-proton collisions at 8\tev of center-of-mass collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The observed dijet invariant mass spectrum is found to be consistent with the expected standard model prediction. Upper limits are set on the cross sections for chargino and neutralino production with two associated jets, assuming the supersymmetric partner of the tau lepton to be the lightest slepton and the lightest slepton to be lighter than the charginos. An additional sensitivity study of the same analysis is performed using 13\tev simulated data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 85\invfb.
