One of the biggest achievements in High Energy physics is the formulation of the Standard Model. Throughout decades 

 as result of decades of close collaboration between the theoretical and experimental scientific community the Standard Model has been able to successfully predict the existence of particles, their physical properties and how to discoved them. THe last biggest discovery goes back to 2012 with the Higgs Boson
 
 Physical e theoretical evidences coming for other physics field has been showing over le last decades that the Standard Model is an incomplete theory. 
 The scientific community shifted the effort over the searches for theoretical extension of the Standard Model
 Supersymmetry is one of the most revant theories (reason?)
 
 The chargino/neutralino system plays a crucial role in the dark matter connection of supersym- metric models. The lightest neutralino   Ìƒ01, as the light- est supersymmetric particle (LSP), is the canonical dark matter candidate in the R-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM)
 
 Among the different searches for charginos and neutralinos
 
The search for chargino and neutralino has the potential to outperform the other searches for charginos and neutralino for SUSY scenarios with compressed spectra and low chargino/ neutralino masses
